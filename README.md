# NLOFC_Discrimation

The theory of NonLinearOpticalFrequencyCombSpectroscopy is derived and modeled in [AnalyticalNLOFC](https://github.com/ayankgp/AnalyticalNLOFC). Here I have utilized this theory to understand discrimination capabilities in systems with similar linear responses but varying nonlinearity. The various steps in this project are:

## Monte Carlo integration of high-dimensional chi3 and calculation of the related covariance
